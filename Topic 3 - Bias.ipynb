    "1. Overconfidence Bias: Research has shown that individuals are more likely to be overconfident in predicting the outcome of sports games due to individual bias (Ronis and Yates, 1987).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Confirmation Bias: Research has shown that confirmation bias ('the tendency to favor information that confirms oneâ€™s preexisting beliefs and ignore information that challenges them') relating to news sources can influence individuals precieved believability of news headlines based on the individuals rating of the source relaibility (Kim and Dennis, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Herd Mentality: Research has shown that during a crisis (i.e. COVID-19 Pandemic), individuals are more likly to engage in Herd Mentality behaviours (a form of cognitive bias defined as \"an alignment of thoughts and/or behaviours of individuals in a group, that emerges without purposeful coordination by a central authority or leading figure, and instead through local interactions among agents\"), such as panic buying, especially when influenced by the media (Loxton et al. 2020).\n",
